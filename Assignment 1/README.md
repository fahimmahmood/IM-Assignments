Big O-notation tells us, how the computational complexity of algorithm increases as input size increases. From Figure 6, we can see that as the input size increases i.e. approaches n=7 in this case, increase in computational complexity of O(logn) is lowest whereas growth rate of 0( nk ) is highest. If we arrange the growth rate of these 5 complexities in ascending order from left to right, the left being the best complexity and the right being the worst complexity we get,

O(logn) > O(n) > O( n2 ) > O( n3 ) > O( nk )

So, logarithmic complexity i.e. O(logn) is the best complexity as it has the lowest growth rate with respect to input size. Similarly, O(n) has lower growth rate compared to O( n2 ) making O(n) better than O( n2 ) and less efficient compared to O(logn).
