# Notebook Links

Sometimes notebook won't load in github straight away. So, I have made my notebooks public and provided the links in the following:

- [My Final/Best Solution](https://www.kaggle.com/fahimmahmood/jigsaw-toxic-comment-detection). I have used Random Forest to achieve 80% accuracy on private dataset.
- [LSTM](https://www.kaggle.com/fahimmahmood/rnn-lstm). I tried to implement LSTM, a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network on my own. My implementation wasn't optimal at all.
  Thus, I achieved 64% accuracy with this model. Will be working on this notebook!
- [BERT with ktrain](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16ixHeQd2nIZ3sbWHkKarTMGglW1rCYMM?usp=sharing) is also a layman's (mine :3) implementation. While generating prediction
  something went wrong which I am yet to figure out. As a result, my predcition for all comments in text data has similar probability. Will work on this notebook and learn more
  about BERT.
  [BERT Submission](https://www.kaggle.com/fahimmahmood/bert-submission) is used to submit the BERT predictions which was generated in from [BERT with ktrain](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16ixHeQd2nIZ3sbWHkKarTMGglW1rCYMM?usp=sharing). I had to use colab to install ktrain as kaggle didn't allow notebook to use internet in this competition.
